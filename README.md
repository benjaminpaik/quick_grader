# quick_grader

An app to quickly grade assignments stored in a Google sheet.

## Overview

The purpose of this app was to provide a way for teachers to update 
grades for various assignments from their phone. A Google sheet stored
in the user's Google Drive is used as the database for all 
assignments. The sheet tabs represent different periods, each row
contains grades for a specific student, and each column represents a
specific assignment.
